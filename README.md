## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The design is inspired by Brittany Chiangâ€™s split-layout approach, featuring a clean and modern user interface.

The layout consists of two main parts:
- A **fixed left panel** that remains visible on all screen sizes, serving as a vertical navigation menu.
- A **scrollable right panel** that displays all the content sections. Navigation links use smooth scrolling to transition between sections for a seamless user experience.

### ðŸ”¹ Sections Included:
- **About:** A brief introduction and personal background
- **Experience:** Professional and internship experience
- **Tech Stack:** Technologies and tools currently used
- **Projects:** Selected work with descriptions and links
- **Certifications:** Verified achievements and credentials

### ðŸŒŸ Features:
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth scroll behavior for in-page navigation
- Scroll-to-top button for improved usability
- Clean, accessible layout focused on readability

This project highlights my front-end development skills, particularly in building responsive UIs with React and Tailwind CSS.
