        I'm a junior frontend developer passionate about building clean,
        accessible, and responsive user interfaces. I specialize in turning
        designs into functional, user-friendly experiences while constantly
        improving my skills in performance and modern web technologies.

      <p className="text-[#A79A86] opacity-80 text-md">
        During my internship at DepEd CALABARZON Region IV-A, I helped develop
        responsive internal web apps, deepening my understanding of usability,
        accessibility, and performance.

        My capstone project, ranked top 10 in my IT department, gave me hands-on
        experience in both frontend and backend development, strengthening my
